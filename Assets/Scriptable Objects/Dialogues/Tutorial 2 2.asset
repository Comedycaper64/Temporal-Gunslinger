    - 'My role here is complicated, but in short, I act as a custodian for this place.
      I maintain the balance of Life and Death, and ensure souls correctly pass into
      the afterlife. '
    - 'Occasionally, I take an interest in souls I feel have been particularly wronged
      by life. I divert their path such that they join me here at the End of Time
      instead. '
    - 'You were the latest soul I have taken an interest in, and now you are my trusted
      friend: something which is painfully rare in this place.'
    - 'But I digress. I am afraid a longer introduction must wait. '
    - I need your aid.
    - Humour me, for a moment, as I explain some things to you.
    - Some time ago, to assist me in my duties, I acquired four souls whom I felt
      were particularly wronged in life, like yourself. I offered them a purpose,
      a second chance to make a difference in the world.
    - Each soul came from a point in time where my influence is at its weakest. I
      named them my Heralds and tasked them with ensuring the order and balance between
      Life and Death. To aid in their duties, I bestowed upon each of them a unique
      power.
    - "You need not worry yourself with the details. What is important is that this
      system has worked flawlessly\u2026 until now."

    dialogue:
    - Indeed.
    - It seems the powers I granted each of my Heralds have gone to their heads.
      They have begun interfering in mortal affairs to serve their own ambitions,
      throwing the balance between Life and Death into disarray.
    - If we allow this to continue, the very fabric of our universe could tear itself
      apart. After our souls are agonisingly eviscerated, you, I, and everybody we
      know and love would cease to exist.
    - To avert this fate, I implored the Heralds to see reason. Unfortunately, I
      realised what they were doing too late, and their hubris has already corrupted
      them beyond recognition.
    - "I have grown close to my subordinates\u2026 my friends. But, for the sake
      of humanity, the time for drastic action is now."

    - I have been watching you for some time now, and see great potential in you.
      Your experience as an assassin in life should serve us both well.
    - However, before I continue, I wish to judge your abilities myself.
    - To aid you, I wish to bestow two gifts of your own upon you.
    - "Firstly, I offer you a collection of Trickshot Coins, each infused with the
      power to change a projectile\u2019s fate."
    - 'You may use these coins to redirect flying projectiles as you see fit. Simply
      fire your weapon [L. Click], and the bullets shall bend to your will. '
    - To practice, I wish for you to use these coins to redirect a single bullet
      and destroy two of my masks.
    - If you fail, do not worry. The second gift I offer you is my own personal Timepiece.
      It will allow you to travel through time as you desire.
    - Right now you will be able to rewind time [R], and accelerate it [F] at your
      discretion.
