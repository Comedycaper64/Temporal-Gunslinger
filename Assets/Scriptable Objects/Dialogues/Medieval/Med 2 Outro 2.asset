    - I had not expected there to be so many guards inside, but no matter. You are
      dealing with them well enough.

    dialogue:
    - That is not strictly true. Their armour is designed in a very particular manner.
    - Simple foot soldiers have weaknesses in their backs. Any who are cowardly enough
      to flee leave themselves exposed and can easily be struck down.
    - "Arbalists cannot fight at close range, and so become useless if they fail
      to keep the Empire\u2019s enemies at bay. Their defenceless faces remind them
      of this."

    - "It is War\u2019s doing. Any too weak to fight are nothing more than a waste
      of resources to him. The Iron Empire was never a merciful nation, but it is
      him that has twisted their ruthlessness into outright brutality."
    - This is why he must be stopped.
