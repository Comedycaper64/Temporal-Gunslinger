    - <alpha=#55>The real <color="red">War</color><alpha=#55> was a good man. Brutish,
      yes, but he was loyal and diligent.
    - <alpha=#55>I do not know what you will find behind those doors, but whatever
      it is, it is not truly <color="red">War</color><alpha=#55>. It is an empty
      shell of his former self, twisted and corrupted by his hunger for power.
    - <alpha=#55>He knows why you are here. He will likely say and do anything he
      can to stop you.
    - <alpha=#55>Do not let him fool you. You must complete your mission, regardless
      of what he tries.
    - <alpha=#55>I will stay with you. Aim true, old friend.
