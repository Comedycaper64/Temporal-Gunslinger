    dialogue:
    - You have performed adequately thus far, but what lies ahead is your first real
      challenge.
    - I believe it is important for me to explain something to you.
    - The real War was a good man. Brutish, yes, but he was loyal and diligent.
    - I do not know what you will find behind those doors, but whatever it is, it
      is not truly War. It is an empty shell of his former self, twisted and corrupted
      by his hunger for power.
    - He knows why you are here. He will likely say and do anything he can to stop
      you.
    - Do not let him fool you. You must complete your mission, regardless of what
      he tries.
    - 'I will stay with you. Aim true, old friend. '
