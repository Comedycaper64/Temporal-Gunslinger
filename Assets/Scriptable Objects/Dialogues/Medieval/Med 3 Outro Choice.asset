      dialogue:
      - <alpha=#88>In life, he was a simple sellsword. His early years consisted
        mostly of mercenary work. He worked for whoever paid the most; slaying bandits,
        peasants and nobles alike. He even killed his <i>own brother</i>.
      - <alpha=#88>Once the Great War started, he was drafted into the army. He did
        not survive his first real battle.
      - <alpha=#88>Some might see him as a <i>reprehensible</i> man, but I took pity
        on him. His mother died during childbirth, and his father contracted Crimson
        Rot when he was still young. Mercenary work paid for food and shelter; I
        doubt he took any pleasure in it.
      - <alpha=#88>I saw great potential in him, not unlike the potential I see in
        you. I redirected his soul to me and used my staff to bestow upon him his
        powers.
      - <alpha=#88>That is a story for another time, however.

      - <alpha=#88>The answer to that is that I am simply the <color="green"><font="BLKCHCRY
        SDF"><b>Reaper</b></font></color><alpha=#88>. I maintain the balance between
        Life and Death, and ensure souls pass correctly to the afterlife once their
        time in the Mortal Realm is up.
      - <alpha=#88>However, I suspect what you really wanted to know is who I <i>used</i>
        to be.

      dialogue:
      - <alpha=#88>I am afraid that is a much tricker question to answer. In truth,
        I do not entirely know. I remember very little of my <i>mortal</i> life.
      - "<alpha=#88>What I do know is that it was not particularly noteworthy. I
        often imagine myself as a\u2026 <i>simple traveller</i>, wandering the realms
        in search of a purpose."
      - <alpha=#88>That said, I do remember finding my staff. I had been travelling
        through a mountain pass when a thunderstorm had descended upon me. I sought
        shelter in a nearby cave and noticed something sticking out of a fissure
        in the rock.
      - <alpha=#88>Holding my torch near, I saw that it was the tip of a gnarled
        staff. I cannot quite put it into words, but there was something <i>unnatural</i>
        about it. It was as if it had been placed there deliberately such that I
        would find it.
      - <alpha=#88>I had a terrible feeling about it, but my <i>curiosity</i> got
        the better of me. I reached out and, when my fingers touched it, a searing
        pain convulsed through my body. In an instant, I collapsed to the ground.
      - <alpha=#88>When I regained my consciousness, I was alone in <color="green">The
        End of Time</color><alpha=#88>. My body had taken on a new form, and a strange
        power broiled inside me like a sea in a storm. In my hand was the staff.
      - <alpha=#88>Does that answer your question?

      - <alpha=#88>I had been observing your life for some time. Despite how much
        you disliked it, you were talented at your work. I believed your skills would
        be <i>transferable</i> here.
      - <alpha=#88>So far, that belief seems to hold true.
