      dialogue:
      - <alpha=#55>In life, he was a weaponsmith turned sellsword. After leaving
        the smithy, his early years were filled mostly with mercenary work. He worked
        for whoever offered the most coin; slaying bandits, peasants and nobles alike.
      - <alpha=#55>Once the Great War started, he was drafted into the army. He did
        not survive his first real battle.
      - <alpha=#55>Some might see him as a <i>reprehensible</i> man, but I took pity
        on him. His mother died during childbirth, and his father contracted Crimson
        Rot when he was still young. Mercenary work paid for food and shelter; I
        doubt he took any pleasure in it.
      - <alpha=#55>I saw great potential in him, not unlike the potential I see in
        you. I redirected his soul to me and used my staff to bestow upon him his
        powers.
      - <alpha=#55>That is a story for another time, however.

      - <alpha=#55>The answer to that is that I am simply the <color="green"><font="BLKCHCRY
        SDF"><b>Reaper</b></font></color><alpha=#55>. I maintain the balance between
        Life and Death, and ensure souls pass correctly to the afterlife once their
        time in the Mortal Realm is up.
      - <alpha=#55>However, I suspect what you really wanted to know is who I <i>used</i>
        to be.

      dialogue:
      - <alpha=#55>I am afraid that is a much trickier question to answer. In truth,
        I do not entirely know. I remember very little of my <i>mortal</i> life.
      - "<alpha=#55>What I do know is that it was not particularly noteworthy. I
        often imagine myself as a\u2026 <i>simple traveller</i>, wandering the realms
        in search of a purpose."
      - <alpha=#55>That said, I do remember finding my staff. I had been travelling
        through a mountain pass when a thunderstorm had descended upon me. I sought
        shelter in a nearby cave and noticed something sticking out of a fissure
        in the rock.
      - <alpha=#55>Holding my torch near, I saw that it was the tip of a gnarled
        staff. I cannot quite put it into words, but there was something <i>unnatural</i>
        about it. It was as if it had been placed there deliberately such that I
        would find it.
      - <alpha=#55>I had a terrible feeling about it, but my curiosity got the better
        of me. I reached out and, when my fingers touched it, a searing pain convulsed
        through my body. In an instant, I collapsed to the ground.
      - <alpha=#55>When I regained my consciousness, I was alone in <color="green">The
        End of Time</color><alpha=#55>. My body had taken on a new form, and a strange
        power broiled inside me like a sea in a storm. In my hand was the staff.
      - <alpha=#55>Does that answer your question?

        you disliked it, you were talented at your work. I believed your skills would
        be <i>transferable</i> here.
      - <alpha=#55>So far, that belief seems to hold true.

        how you resented the way they forced your hand again and again.

        you inside that warehouse and set the building aflame.
