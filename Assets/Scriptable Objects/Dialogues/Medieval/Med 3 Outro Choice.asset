      dialogue:
      - In life, he was a simple sellsword. His early years comprised mostly of mercenary
        work. He worked for whoever paid the most, slaying bandits, peasants and
        nobles alike. He even killed his own brother.
      - Once the Great War started, he was drafted into the army. I do not believe
        he survived his first real battle.
      - Some might see him as a reprehensible man, but I took pity on him. His mother
        died during childbirth, and his father contracted Crimson Rot when he was
        still young. Mercenary work paid for food and shelter; I doubt he took any
        pleasure in it.
      - I saw great potential in him, not unlike the potential I see in you. I redirected
        his soul to me and used my staff to bestow upon him his powers.
      - That is a story for another time, however.

      - The answer to that is that I am simply the Reaper. I maintain the balance
        between Life and Death, and ensure souls pass correctly to the afterlife
        once their time in the Mortal Realm is up.
      - However, I suspect that is not what you meant.

      dialogue:
      - I am afraid that is a much tricker question to answer. In truth, I do not
        entirely know. I remember very little of my mortal life.
      - 'What I do know is that it was not particularly noteworthy. I often imagine
        myself as a simple traveller, wandering the realms in search of a purpose. '
      - 'That said, I do remember finding my staff. I had been travelling through
        a mountain pass when a thunderstorm had descended upon me. I sought shelter
        in a nearby cave and noticed something sticking out of a fissure in the rock. '
      - Holding my torch near, I saw that it was the tip of a gnarled staff. I cannot
        quite put it into words, but there was something unnatural about it. It was
        as if it had been placed there deliberately such that I would find it.
      - I had a terrible feeling about it, but my curiosity got the better of me.
        I reached out and, when my fingers touched it, a searing pain convulsed through
        my body. In an instant, I collapsed to the ground.
      - When I regained my consciousness, I was alone in the End of Time. My body
        had taken on a new form, and a strange power broiled inside me like a sea
        in a storm. In my hand was the staff.
      - Does that answer your question?

      - I had been observing your life for some time. Despite how much you disliked

        here.
      - So far, that belief seems to hold true.

      - Unlike them, I believe you deserve a second chance.

        disliked working for them, and how you resented the way they forced your
        hand again and again. '
      - I heard your screams of anger as they promised you freedom, trapped you inside
        that warehouse and set the building aflame.
      - 'I felt your despair. I felt your hatred. I felt your desire for vengeance. '
      - That is why I chose you, old friend. Only someone like you could truly understand
        the pain of such a betrayal.
      - Only someone like you can stop the Heralds.
