      - You seem to be in a hallway of the Imperial Castle, the heart of the Iron
        Empire and widely known today as the most fortified stronghold of the Medieval
        Era.
      - "War\u2019s influence has been more prominent than I first thought. The Emperor
        is amassing an enormous army. I suspect he will launch his final attack upon
        the nations of the world imminently."
      - We must act quickly.

      dialogue:
      - You assume correctly. War has possessed the leader of the Iron Empire and
        has amassed an army strong enough to conquer every other nation in the world.
      - Subtlety was never his strong suit. I can sense the source of his corruption
        from here.
