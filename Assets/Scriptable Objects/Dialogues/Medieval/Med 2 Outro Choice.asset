      - <alpha=#55>If only it were that simple, old friend.
      - <alpha=#55>My Heralds have mastered the art of slipping through time almost
        imperceptibly. If we strike too early, they will easily escape. This would
        merely delay their plans at best.
      - "<alpha=#55>When manifesting, a Herald\u2019s influence may be at its strongest,
        but they are also defensively at their weakest. It becomes <i>difficult</i>
        to flee once you have thoroughly entrenched yourself in a physical form."
      - <alpha=#55>Waiting until now may make the journey to them more challenging,
        but it gives us the best chance of stopping them once we are there.

      dialogue:
      - <alpha=#55>That is not <i>strictly</i> true. The weaknesses in their armour
        are very deliberate.
      - <alpha=#55>Simple foot soldiers have weaknesses on the backs of their breastplates.
        Any who are cowardly enough to flee leave themselves exposed and can easily
        be struck down.
      - "<alpha=#55>Archers cannot fight at close range, and so become useless if
        they fail to keep the Empire\u2019s enemies at bay. Their defenceless faces
        remind them of this."
      - <alpha=#55>To <color="red">War</color><alpha=#55>, any too weak to fight
        are a waste of resources. The Vincerian Empire was never a merciful nation,
        but it is him that has twisted their ruthlessness into outright brutality.
      - <alpha=#55>This is why he must be stopped.
