    - Interesting. This one does not appear to have any parts of his body exposed.
    - "I suspect this is one of War\u2019s favourites. He will have proven himself
      useful and demonstrated unwavering loyalty, earning himself full protection."
    - It would seem War does not view every human life as expendable after all.
    - He is not without weakness though. The extraordinary weight of his armour will
      be his downfall.
