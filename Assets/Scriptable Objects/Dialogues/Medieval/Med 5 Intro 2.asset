    - These injustices flourish beneath his watch. For too long they hath persisted,
      and I can stand idle no longer.
    - And so I kindled a war. A war that culls the weak, ignites the fires of innovation,
      and provides a common foe for humanity to strive against.
    - Through this destruction, the peoples of this world will unite against me and
      bring about the change it doth sorely need.

    - <alpha=#55>The goals he claims to seek may sound admirable, but his twisted
      methods poorly conceal his true motives.
    - <alpha=#55>Surely it is clear he seeks to use this war to conquer every nation
      of the world and gain total control over the Mortal Realm?
    - "<alpha=#55>If you do not intervene, all of humanity will be forced to grovel
      before him, and I will be powerless to stop it.\r"

    - Victory lies within my grasp, yet thou wouldst wrest it from me in the final
      hour? Thou art on the wrong side of this war, little sheep. But if thou still
      standest in my path, then so be it.
    - 'Your end draws near. Any last words?
