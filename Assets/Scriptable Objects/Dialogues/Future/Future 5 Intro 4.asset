    - "Any road up, not much point in delaying the inevitable any further, is there?
      Whether you want to or not, you\u2019ve got your mission to do. \r\n"
    - "Go on then. Tell the Reaper he\u2019s an evil git, then get your pistol out.
      I\u2019ll go grab me walking stick."
    - "I\u2019ve slowed down a bit in me old age, but you know what they say."
    - Life comes at you fast, but Death? You never see Death coming.
