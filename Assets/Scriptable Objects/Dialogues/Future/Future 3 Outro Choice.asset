        that Death has possessed is the only living crew member that remains here.
        I suspect some of her latent power has corrupted this place into appearing
        as it is not.\r"

      dialogue:
      - This time, there is little to tell.
      - Death lived for an exceedingly long time. Near the end of her lifespan, it
        became possible to indefinitely extend mortal life expectancy through supplements,
        and so she continued to live on.
      - But as the world shifted around her over the years, it began to take its
        toll. Where she was once driven and wise, she became skeptical and dour.
        Several decades later, she finally stopped taking the supplements and passed
        on naturally.
      - It seemed a waste for a mind so bright to be lost like that. And so, as her
        soul passed me by, I decided to interfere with her fate. With that, she became
        my first Herald.
      - 'She was a fascinating person to converse with. Together, we spent much time
        deciphering the nature of artefacts we held and the latent powers we manifested
        from them. '
      - Of all the Heralds, she was the closest I had to a friend. And yet, she was
        the first to betray me.

      dialogue:
      - As I stated before, that will depend on the outcome of your task.
      - But consider each Herald is a traitor who has wilfully abused their powers
        to change the state of the world. Such a grave transgression cannot be righted
        with a simple slap on the wrist.
