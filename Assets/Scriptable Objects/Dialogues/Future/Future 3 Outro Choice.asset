      - <alpha=#55>This time, there is little to tell.
      - <alpha=#88>Death<alpha=#55> lived for an exceedingly long time. Near the
        end of her lifespan, it became possible to indefinitely extend mortal life
        expectancy through supplements, and so she continued to live on.
      - <alpha=#55>But as the world shifted around her over the years, it began to
        take its toll. Where she was once driven and wise, she became skeptical and
        dour. Several decades later, she finally stopped taking the supplements and
        passed on naturally.
      - <alpha=#55>It seemed a waste for a mind so bright to be lost like that. And
        so, as her soul passed me by, I decided to interfere with her fate. With
        that, she became my first Herald.
      - '<alpha=#55>She was a fascinating person to converse with. Together, we spent
        much time deciphering the nature of artefacts we held and the latent powers
        we manifested from them. '
      - <alpha=#55>Of all the Heralds, she was the closest I had to a friend. And
        yet, she was the first to betray me.

        cannot be righted with a simple slap on the wrist.
