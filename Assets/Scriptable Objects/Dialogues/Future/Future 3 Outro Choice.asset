      - This time there is not terribly much to tell.
      - "Death lived for a very long time. It became possible to artificially enhance
        a person\u2019s lifespan when she was near the end of her life, and so she
        continued to live on."
      - "\rShe was driven and wise, but the world changed in many ways and it broke
        her. She cut her own life short.\r\n"
      - It seemed a waste for such a passionate person to meet their end like that.
        As her soul passed me by, I rashly decided to interfere with her fate. With
        that, she became my first Herald.
      - She was a fascinating person to converse with, we spent much time trying
        to figure out the nature of the powers and artifacts that we held.
      - "And yet\u2026 she was the first to betray me. Such wanton foolishness."

      - I thought I made it clear that it depended on how this last mission resolves.
      - These are traitors who have wilfully abused their power to change the state
        of the world. Such a grave misdeed will not be undone with a simple slap
        on the wrist.
      - You cannot know what possible effect an ill-thought, drastic, emotionally-charged
        action could have.
