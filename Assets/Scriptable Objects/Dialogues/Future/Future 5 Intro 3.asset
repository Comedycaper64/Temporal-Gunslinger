    - "It\u2019s being destroyed."
    - A few of those corporate-elitist types run the world now. Everybody else is
      kept alive with supplements so they can keep working themselves to the bone.
    - Most of the life that existed a hundred years ago is now extinct. Only the
      animals and plants most easy to farm and manufacture were kept.
    - "That planet has existed for billions of years, and look at the state of it.
      Look at what we\u2019ve done to it."
    - "It\u2019s a bloody disgrace, is what it is. A disgrace, and a shame."
    - "Well, I\u2019ve just about had enough. Somebody\u2019s got to end it\u2019s
      suffering, and the suffering of everyone forced into this and all."
    - "That somebody\u2019s little old me. <i>I\u2019m going to wipe the slate clean.</i>"

    - Every human will die, along with the rest of their destroyed world.
    - Me only hope is that that planet is resilient. After millions, maybe even billions
      of years, life might form once again. Then, a new people can rise from the
      ashes.

    - "As for this place, most of humanity\u2019s knowledge and history is recorded
      up here. I\u2019ve been curating it, getting rid of all the stuff that might
      cause a new civilisation to head in the same direction as we did."
    - "Long after everyone\u2019s gone, this archive will crash down into the world
      below. Hopefully whoever finds it can put it to some good use - if there\u2019s
      anything left of it, that is."
    - "All in all, it\u2019s a pretty rubbish plan. But I\u2019d rather do <i>something</i>
      than sit and watch the world burn."

    - Do you see now the madness she has descended into? She would kill every living
