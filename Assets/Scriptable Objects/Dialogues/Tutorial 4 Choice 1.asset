      - 'Of course: payment. I expected no less. You were a contract killer, after
        all.'
      - In return for eliminating the Heralds, I can offer you three options.
      - Firstly, I can grant you power almost equal to my own. You would have control
        over Life and Death. Within reason, reality would be yours to shape.
      - Secondly, I could simply relieve you of your duties. You would no longer
        be bound here and would be free to pass on into the afterlife.
      - 'Finally, I could send your soul back to the Mortal Realm. You would have
        a second chance at life, you could see your family and friends again, and
        I could ensure things go smoothly for you. '
      - 'This would be taxing for me to do, but I feel that it is only fair given
        the task I am asking you to perform.  '

      - I would not joke about such serious matters.  Indeed, I would not joke about
        any matter.
      - I also would not force you into anything. If you wish, I can release you
        of your duties immediately. You would stay here with me until the very end,
        watching the world tear itself apart around us.
      - 'Then, as the last of the light within the universe is extinguished, we too
        would be torn apart.

        Is that what you would prefer, old friend?'
