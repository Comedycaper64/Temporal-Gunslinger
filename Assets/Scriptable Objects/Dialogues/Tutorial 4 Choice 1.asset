      - 'Of course: payment. I expected no less. You were a contract killer, after
        all.'
      - In return for eliminating the Heralds, I can offer you three options.
      - Firstly, I can grant you power almost equal to my own. You would have control
        over Life and Death. Within reason, reality would be yours to shape.
      - Secondly, I could simply relieve you of your duties. You would no longer
        be bound here and would be free to pass on into the afterlife.
      - 'Finally, I could send your soul back to the Mortal Realm. You would have
        a second chance at life, you could see your family and friends again, and
        I could ensure things go smoothly for you. '
      - 'This would be taxing for me to do, but I feel that it is only fair given
        the task I am asking you to perform.  '

        I am bound here in turn."
      - You are also more familiar with weapons and assassination than I.
