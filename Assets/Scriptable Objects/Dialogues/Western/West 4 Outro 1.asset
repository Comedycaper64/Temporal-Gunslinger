    dialogue:
    - ...
    - There is a burden upon my heart I must cast off.
    - When I possessed the Emperor, I had almost entirely lost myself. My pride in
      mine own strength blinded me to thy skill. When thou bested me in our battle,
      I was so overcome with rage that I lashed out at thee.
    - "But \u2018tis not thee I resent, and I have vented my frustrations with the
      <color=\"green\">Reaper</color> upon thee unjustly."
    - I wish to apologise for how I have treated thee. Thou art both skilful in battle
      and silent with thy thoughts, a quality I much admire.
    - In truth, thou dost remind me of myself when I was alive. Hath the <color="green">Reaper</color>
      explained who I was before I became a Herald?
