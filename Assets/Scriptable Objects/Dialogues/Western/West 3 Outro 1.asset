    - I was going easy on thou when thou defeated me, yet now I see why the <color="green">Reaper</color>
      chose thee for this task.
    - A little sloppy in some places, methinks, yet overall that was another decent
      fight.
    - Yet even the most skilled knight can be bested in battle if they lack an understanding
      of their foe.
    - "We know far too little of <color=\"yellow\">Famine</color> thus far. \u2018Twould
      be wise to interrogate the <color=\"green\">Reaper</color> on this matter."
