    - "He claims it to be a Herald\u2019s influence? I had thought such power was
      unique to <color=\"yellow\">Famine</color>."
    - I know not the full extent of my powers, but I suppose they were able to keep
      the <color="green">Reaper</color> at bay.
    - Could it be the Heralds are able to exert greater control over him than I had
      imagined?
    - This requires further investigation. Strive not to get us slain.
