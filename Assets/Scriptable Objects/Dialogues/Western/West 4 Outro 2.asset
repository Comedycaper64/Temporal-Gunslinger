    - "I trust I am not interrupting anything important. I feel you are getting close.\r"
    - 'Allow me to remind you of your task. Famine has possessed the leader of a
      rapidly expanding oil company, and has been buying up land across the country.

'
    - "Making so many deals in such a short period of time shows that Famine\u2019s
      most powerful weapon is his words. War\u2019s impassioned speech will likely
      pale in comparison to the bargains he will offer and the lies he will weave
      to avoid fighting you.\r\n"
    - "Do not let him fool you, old friend.\r"
