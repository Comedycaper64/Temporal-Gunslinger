    - Curious. This creature seems to be of Famine's making. His influence corrupts
      his followers more that I imagined possible.

    - It seems this creature is covered in a toughened carapace. A single bullet
      may not be enough to pierce it.
    - And Famine's influence is... stronger than I expected. I can almost feel his
      withering grasp clutching for my own power. It is limiting how many coins I
      can spare.

    - "Famine doth starve the Reaper as well? Such a turn I did not foresee. I had
      thought him untouchable\u2026"
    - 'So be it. If thy weapon is too pitiful and the Reaper too weak to aid, then
      I must lend my own strength. Call upon me [C], and we shall vanquish this beast
      together.
