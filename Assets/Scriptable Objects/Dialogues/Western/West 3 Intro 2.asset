    - This place doth swarm with these beasts, yet the Reaper remains as pitiful
      as ever.
    - 'Thankfully thy abilities in combat seem adequate, at least. Thou hast handled
      our enemies well enough thus far.

'
    - 'If the Reaper is still too weak to aid thee, I shall continue to stand by
      thy side.
