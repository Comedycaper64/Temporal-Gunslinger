    - "Here\u2019s the thing. Some fat cats, myself included, make more dough than
      they know what to do with, while thousands of common folk barely make enough
      to feed themselves.  \r\n"
    - "Trouble is, there\u2019s too many folks for the world to cope. Even if we
      shared all that wealth equally, there would still plenty of sufferin\u2019.\r"
    - "Any good man can see that ain\u2019t right. Fortunately, I find myself as
      the <cspace=0.15em>big bug</cspace> of this here oil company, and I have a
      whole heap of capital to spend."
    - "I\u2019ve been buyin\u2019 up land. \u201CLookin\u2019 for oil\u201D, I tell
      folk, and nobody bats an eye. I own more fields, farms and fertile land than
      anybody else in the country, and I ain\u2019t plannin\u2019 on stoppin\u2019
      there."
