      - 'In life, Famine was a cattle rancher. He lived in a farmstead in the Golden
        Sands with his wife and five children. The land was barren, and most years
        he and his family barely grew enough to sustain themselves and their livestock.

'
      - They sold what little they could spare to save up for a better life away
        from the frontier.
      - It was that dream that motivated them for years, until a long drought struck.
        A swarm of locusts destroyed half of their crops, and the sun wilted the
        rest. The cattle died soon after.
      - Without anything else to sustain themselves, soon their savings also ran
        dry. After half a year, Famine finally watched his children, then his wife,
        succumb to exhaustion. Alone in the world, he followed them soon after.

        to unsuspecting buyers at markets. He kept his charismatic demeanor and quick
        wit when I named him my Herald.

'
      - ' I suspect he will try to use these skills to his advantage. Despite this,
        you must stay focused on your goal, old friend.
