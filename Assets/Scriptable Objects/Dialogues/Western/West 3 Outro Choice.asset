      dialogue:
      - <alpha=#55>In life, <color="yellow">Famine</color><alpha=#55> was a cattle
        rancher. He lived in a farmstead in the Golden Sands with his wife and five
        children. The land was barren, and most years he and his family barely grew
        enough to sustain themselves and their livestock.
      - "<alpha=#55>They sold what little they could spare to save up for a better
        life away from the frontier.\r"
      - <alpha=#55>It was that dream that motivated them for years, until a long
        drought struck. A swarm of locusts destroyed half of their crops, and the
        sun wilted the rest. The cattle died soon after.
      - <alpha=#55>Without anything else to sustain themselves, soon their savings
        also ran dry. After half a year, Famine finally watched his children, then
        his wife, succumb to exhaustion. Alone in the world, he followed them soon
        after.

      - How can the <color="green">Reaper</color> allow such suffering to persist?
        Surely there is something that can be do-

      - <alpha=#55>In his life, <color="yellow">Famine</color><alpha=#55> spent much
        time selling sick cows and poor quality crops to unsuspecting buyers at markets.
        He kept his charismatic demeanour and quick wit when I named him my Herald.
      - <alpha=#55>I suspect he will try to use these skills to his advantage. Despite
        this, you must stay focused on your goal, old friend.

        to you is more than an <i>ordinary</i> relic. It is able to grant you power
        over time and allows me to communicate with you because a fragment of myself
        is contained within it.
      - <alpha=#55>My control is limited, particularly when a Herald is exerting
        their influence nearby, but I aid when I can.
