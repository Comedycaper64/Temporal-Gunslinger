      - Very well, in which case allow me to introduce myself. I am the <color="green"><font="BLKCHCRY
        SDf"><b>Reaper</b></font></color>.
      - My role here is <i>complicated</i>, but in short, I act as a custodian for
        this place. I maintain the balance of Life and Death, and ensure souls correctly
        pass into the afterlife.
      - Occasionally, I take an interest in souls I feel have been particularly wronged
        by life. I divert their path such that they join me here at <color="green">The
        End of Time</color> instead.
      - 'You were the latest soul I had taken an interest in, and now you are my
        <i>trusted friend</i>: something which is painfully rare in this place.'
      - But I digress. A longer introduction will have to wait. We must do this correctly.
