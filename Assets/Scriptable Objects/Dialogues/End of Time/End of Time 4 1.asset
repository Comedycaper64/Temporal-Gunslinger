    dialogue:
    - As expected, you use my gifts well, old friend. I am glad to see they are not
      <i>wasted</i> upon you.
    - Now, onto your task.
    - Some time ago, I acquired four wayward souls and employed them as my <b>Heralds</b>.
      I tasked them with assisting me in maintaining the balance between Life and
      Death.
    - Although their initial work was satisfactory, they soon began to abuse the
      powers I bestowed upon them by <i>interfering</i> in mortal affairs to further
      their own ambitions.
    - Their actions have thrown the balance between Life and Death into disarray.
      I cannot allow this to continue, and though it pains me to say this, they must
      be eliminated.
    - My Heralds have begun a rebellion, each possessing a powerful figure from the
      times they walked the world as living souls. As we speak, they are growing
      their power, influencing the actions and decisions of their hosts to serve
      their own goals.
    - Once strong enough, each Herald will fully take over and unleash <i>chaos</i>
      upon the Mortal Realm. I wish for you to eliminate them before this transpires.
