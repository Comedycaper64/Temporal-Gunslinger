    dialogue:
    - "My role here is <i>complicated</i>, but in short, I act as a custodian for
      this place. I maintain the balance of Life and Death, and ensure souls correctly
      pass into the afterlife.\r"
    - Occasionally, I take an interest in souls I feel have been <i>particularly</i>
      wronged by life. I divert their path such that they join me here at <color="green">The
      End of Time</color> instead.
    - 'You were the latest soul I had taken an interest in, and now you are my <i>trusted
      friend</i>: something which is painfully rare in this place.'
    - 'But I digress. I am afraid a longer introduction must wait. '
    - "<align=\"center\"><size=125%><voffset=-1em>I need your aid.\r"
    - I have been watching you for some time, and I see great potential in you. I
      believe your experience as an assassin in life will be useful in the situation
      I find myself in.
    - However, before I continue, I wish to judge your abilities myself.
    - I do not doubt you, old friend, but this task will require more than skill
      and luck. I wish to bestow upon you two gifts.
    - I grant to you my own personal <color="green">Timepiece</color>. Simply put,
      it grants the power to <b>control time</b>.
    - For now it will allow you to <b>rewind</b> time and <b>speed up</b> the passage
      of time.
    - And it seems that... yes. You'll have an ability very <i>fitting</i> for your
      work.
    - I will grant you... <color="green">Reaper coins</color>, each infused with
      the power to change a projectile's fate. They will allow you to <b>redirect</b>
      flying projectiles as you see fit. Your bullets shall bend to your will.
    - To practise, I wish for you to use these <color="green">coins</color> to redirect
      a single bullet to destroy two of my masks.
    - If you fail, do not worry. The <color="green">Timepiece</color> can rewind
      any mistake.
    - "Now, onto our test. Take your time, and understand your new powers.\r"
