    - "My role here is <i>complicated</i>, but in short, I act as a custodian for
      this place. I maintain the balance of Life and Death, and ensure souls correctly
      pass into the afterlife.\r"
    - Occasionally, I take an interest in souls I feel have been <i>particularly</i>
      wronged by life. I divert their path such that they join me here at <color="green">The
      End of Time</color> instead.
    - 'You were the latest soul I had taken an interest in, and now you are my <i>trusted
      friend</i>: something which is painfully rare in this place.'
    - But I digress. A longer introduction will have to wait. We must do this correctly.
    - "<align=\"center\"><size=125%><voffset=-1em>I need your aid.\r"
    - I have been watching you for some time, and I see great potential in you. I
      believe your experience as an assassin in life will be useful in the situation
      I find myself in.
    - However, before I continue, I wish to judge your abilities myself.
    - I do not doubt you, old friend, but this task will require more than skill
      and luck. To aid you, I shall bestow two gifts upon you.

    dialogue:
    - Firstly, I give to you my own personal <color="green">Timepiece</color>. Simply
      put, it grants the power to control the flow of time.
    - As for your second gift, it seems that... Yes, you shall have an ability very
      <i>fitting</i> for your work.
    - I will grant you <color="green">Reaper coins</color>, each infused with the
      power to change a projectile's fate. They will allow you to <b>redirect</b>
      flying projectiles as you see fit. Your bullets shall bend to your will.
    - To practise, I wish for you to use these <color="green">coins</color> to redirect
      a single bullet to destroy two of my masks.
    - If you fail, do not worry. The <color="green">Timepiece</color> can rewind
      any mistake.
    - "Now, onto our test. Take your time, and understand your new powers.\r"
