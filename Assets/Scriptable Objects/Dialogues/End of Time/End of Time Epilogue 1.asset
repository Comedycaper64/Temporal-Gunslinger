    dialogue:
    - Welcome back. All of you.
    - Congratulations, old friend. You have brought the Heralds to heel and successfully
      completed your mission. I am pleased with your performance.
    - 'As for the rest of you, there is very little to say. While I acknowledge the
      assistance you have offered the Revenant, the seriousness of your transgressions
      cannot be overlooked. '
    - When I named you my Heralds, I trusted each of you with aiding me in my duties.
      I made the consequences of interfering with the delicate balance of Life and
      Death perfectly clear, and yet each of you chose to defy me.
    - It is only because of the Revenant that I was able to intervene before your
      childish fantasies of better worlds brought about its destruction.
    - "However, that is all behind us now. With matters returned to my control, I
      will not make the same mistake again. Revenant, my final request is for you
      to relinquish your powers to me. That timepiece belongs to me, after all.\r"
    - Once you do, you will be released from your duties.
