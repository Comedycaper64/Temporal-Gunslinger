      - "I heard all of your conversations. Once I had listened to <color=\"red\">War</color>\u2019s
        rantings, I anticipated that he and the other Heralds would continue to try
        to twist you against me.\r"
      - "Deceiving you about this brought me no pleasure. Had I revealed my hand,
        however, they likely would have found other methods to communicate with you
        that I would not have been able to listen to.\r"
      - "I could not take that risk.\r"
      - Of course, I knew that the Heralds were likely to be suspicious that I supposedly
        could not hear them outside of the End of Time. That is why I sent you to
        deal with <color="red">War</color> first.
      - "He is the most easily fooled, yet his hot-headed confidence made him perfect
        for convincing the other Heralds on my behalf.\r"

      dialogue:
      - Ah. Our deal.
      - Now that you have returned your powers to me, I suppose there is no harm
        in revealing the truth.
      - "Using the powers I granted, you were able to alter the course of a projectile\u2019s
        fate - until it lost momentum."
      - "The same is true of souls. Once a soul\u2019s trajectory is changed and
        is diverted to the End of Time, it quickly loses the momentum necessary to
        reach the afterlife."
      - "In other words, even though I want to, I cannot reverse fate. Your soul\u2019s
        trajectory has already been determined, and thus my end of the deal cannot
        be fulfilled."
      - In truth, I knew this would always be the outcome. However, when evaluating
        between allowing a single soul to pass onto the afterlife and the fate of
        the entire universe, the correct choice is obvious.
      - "I knew that promising your freedom would be the only way to guarantee that
        you would assist me. Deceiving you was an unfortunate but necessary step
        to ensure this world\u2019s survival, and I do not regret my actions."

      dialogue:
      - I cannot be certain, although I have my suspicions.
      - In this place, time does not flow as it does in the mortal realm. Events
        do not happen chronologically - instead, at any given moment there are an
        infinite number of events which occur.
      - "Although these events seem new to us as they play out around us, in truth
        they have happened an infinite number of times before, and will happen an
        infinite number of times again. Even the words I speak now will be uttered
        over and over again, as indeed they already have been.\r"
      - I have never explained this to the Heralds, but <alpha=#88>Death<alpha=#FF>
        always was the sharpest amongst them. It is no surprise that she appears
        to have deduced this fact for herself. Yet it is curious that, despite her
        understanding, she still believes these endless echoes can somehow change.
      - We have done all of this before.
      - 'And we shall do it all over again, old friend. '
