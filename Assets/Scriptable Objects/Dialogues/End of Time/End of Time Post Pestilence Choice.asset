      - To humour your perspective, let us refer to it as the Future Era.
      - Death comes from a time after your own passing. The world has changed in
        a great many ways words cannot describe. In any other situation, you would
        likely find it too unfamiliar and overwhelming to focus.
      - However, Death is a stickler for tradition. I suspect she will have warped
        her surroundings to reflect a time more familiar to her and, by extension,
        to you.
      - Do not let her fondness of the past fool you, however. She is a bitter and
        spiteful woman, and she has an exceedingly sharp mind. She may even have
        foreseen your arrival.
      - Remain on your guard, and you shall see the truth. Death will destroy the
        world directly if you do not stop her.
