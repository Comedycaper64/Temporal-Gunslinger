      - To humour your perspective, let us refer to it as the Future Era.
      - <alpha=#88>Death<alpha=#FF> comes from a time after your own passing. The
        world has changed in a great many ways words cannot describe. In any other
        situation, you would likely find it too unfamiliar and overwhelming to focus.
      - However, <alpha=#88>Death<alpha=#FF> is a stickler for tradition. I suspect
        she will have warped her surroundings to reflect a time more familiar to
        her and, by extension, to you.
      - Do not let her fondness of the past fool you, however. She is a bitter and
        spiteful woman, and she has an exceedingly sharp mind. She may even have
        foreseen your arrival.
      - Remain on your guard, and you shall see the truth. <alpha=#55>Death<alpha=#FF>
        will destroy the world directly if you do not stop her.
