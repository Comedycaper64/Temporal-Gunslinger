      - "Of course: payment. I expected no less. You were a <i>contract killer</i>,
        after all.\r"
      - In return for eliminating the Heralds, I can offer you two options.
      - Firstly, I could simply relieve you of your duties. You would no longer be
        bound here and would be free to pass on into the afterlife.
      - Alternatively, I could send your soul back to the Mortal Realm. You would
        have a second chance at life, you could see those close to you again, and
        I could ensure things go <i>smoothly</i> for you.
      - 'This would be taxing for me to do, but I feel that it is only fair given
        the task I am asking you to perform.  '

        nothing more than this place\u2019s custodian. While I hold <i>great power</i>,
        I am bound here in turn."
      - Additionally, you are more familiar with weapons and assassination than I.
        In this matter, your talent far outshines my own.

      - I would not joke about such serious matters.
      - I also would not <i>force</i> you into anything. If you wish, I can release
        you of your duties immediately. You would stay here with me until the very
        end, watching the world tear itself apart around us.
      - 'Then, as the last of the light within the universe is extinguished, we too
        would be torn apart. Is that what you would prefer, <i>old friend</i>?
