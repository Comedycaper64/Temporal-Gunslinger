      - "Of course: payment. I expected no less. You were a <i>contract killer</i>,
        after all.\r"
      - In return for eliminating the Heralds, I can offer you two options.
      - Firstly, I could simply relieve you of your duties. You would no longer be
        bound here and would be free to pass on into the afterlife.
      - Alternatively, I could send your soul back to the Mortal Realm. You would
        have a second chance at life, you could see those close to you again, and
        I could ensure things go <i>smoothly</i> for you.
      - 'This would be taxing for me to do, but I feel that it is only fair given
        the task I am asking you to perform.  '

        I am bound here in turn."
      - You are also more familiar with weapons and <i>assassination</i> than I.

      - I would not joke about such serious matters.
      - I also would not <i>force</i> you into anything. If you wish, I can release
        you of your duties immediately. You would stay here with me until the very
        end, watching the world tear itself apart around us.
      - 'Then, as the <cspace=0.25em>last of the light</cspace> within the universe
        is extinguished, we too would be torn apart. Is that what you would prefer,
        <i>old friend</i>?
