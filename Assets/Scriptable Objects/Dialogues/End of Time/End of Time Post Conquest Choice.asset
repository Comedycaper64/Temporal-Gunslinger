        The feeble and the mighty each bent the knee at my gaze. \u2018Twas with

        I saw fit. "

        the power along with it. If it were to be returned to me\u2026"

      - Indeed. Allow me to explain.
      - "To each of my Heralds, I bestowed a single relic which granted a single
        power. However, making contact with such a powerful relic can awaken one\u2019s
        latent ability. In <color=\"red\">War</color>\u2019s case, his time as a
        weaponsmith appears to have influenced this ability."
      - The same happened to you, old friend. The <color="green">Timepiece</color>
        is the item of power I gave you. The power to redirect bullets is one that
        <i>you</i> manifested.
      - However, to be clear, this power still comes from the staff. I have partial
        control over how you use it because of the <color="green">coins</color>.
      - I foolishly gave the Heralds full control over their latent powers. I have
        learned from my errors.

        tongue to try to sway your resolve and avoid his fate.

        there are three other Heralds which I require assistance in dealing with.
      - Now, given you are aiding in this task, I expect you to turn your attention
        to the fate of the world instead of pointlessly needling me.
