      - You bested me without knowing my powers? This humiliation is too much to
        bear...
      - ...
      - <size=125%>* sigh *<size=100%>... I was imbued with two powers when I became
        a Herald.
      - One was tied to my sword, Balmung. I was able to dominate others with my
        presence, leading the populace to single-mindedly work for the war effort.
      - The Reaper has reclaimed the sword, and the power along with it.
      - "Although\u2026 aye, I still have some control over my latent ability to
        conjure portals. I presume that is how the Reaper wishes me to contribute."

      dialogue:
      - Ah, I shall explain.
      - To each of my friends I have bestowed a single item, and with it a single
        ability. But making contact with a powerful relic can awaken one's latent
        ability.
      - The same happened to you, old friend. The <color="green">Timepiece</color>
        is the item of power I gave you. The power to redirect bullets is one that
        <i>you</i> manifested.
      - Though, <i>to be clear</i>, this power still comes from the staff. I have
        partial control over how you use it because of the <color="green">coins</color>.
      - I foolishly gave the Heralds full control over their latent powers. I will
        <i>not</i> make such a mistake again.

        to sway you once you come face-to-face.

      - "Furthermore, he has an affinity with money. <i>Any</i> currency, to be exact.\r"
      - I fear that it may be difficult for me to grant you <color="green">coins</color>
        while you are within his domain.
