    - You have done well to get this far, Revenant. One last Herald remains, and
      your duty shall be fulfilled.
    - This last act will prove challenging, I expect the combined effort of everyone
      here will be required. That includes you, Pestilence.

      the Revenant.'
    - If that ceases to be the case, then I will leave you to wander the End of Time
      forevermore.

    - Hah! Is that so? From your logic, it seems all of us have been harbingers of
      apocalyptic events. Mayhaps Death is simply following her heart to enact change
      upon the world?
