    dialogue:
    - "Do you know why I attempted to intervene with the Heralds\u2019 actions?"
    - Whenever they would go to enact a change upon the world, I would peer through
      time to see its outcomes.
    - What I saw was terrifying.
    - Over and over, the universe would become unrecognisable through the impacts
      of even the most minor actions.
    - "After witnessing a hundred times\u2026 I was afraid. I could not let that
      happen."
    - They listened at first, but soon grew tired of my interference. Once they had
      entrenched themselves in the Mortal Realm, I was able to stop them no longer.
    - ...
    - I know you think of me as a tyrant. Perhaps I am. But I did only what I thought
      best for the universe with the power I had been given.
    - "That power lies in your hands now. I do not envy your position. Just\u2026
      be careful. Please."
