    dialogue:
    - I heard all of your conversations. I admit, claiming I could only hear the
      Revenant outside the end of time was a flimsy lie at best. Fortunately, you
      were easily fooled, War.
    - From there, you convinced the others for me. I did not need to lift a finger.
    - My Heralds betrayed my trust and faced grave consequences, yet you would still
      follow in their footsteps?
    - I cannot fully comprehend this foolishness, but my patience wears thin. It
      is time to put an end to this once and for all.
    - Your betrayal was predictable, and your downfall was inevitable. Farewell,
      my treacherous friends.
