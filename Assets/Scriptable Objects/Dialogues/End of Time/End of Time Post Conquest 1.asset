    - You may be wondering why we are still able to hear <color="red">War</color>.
      Perhaps I should have explained this sooner.
    - Once a Herald has manifested strongly enough within a host, their soul requires
      a physical form to survive. When you killed the Emperor, you forced <color="red">War</color>
      out of his body.
    - His soul has latched onto the only other vessel powerful enough to contain
      it. Because of the power the <color="green">Timepiece</color> has granted,
      that vessel is you.

      shall be plenty of time to reflect upon your actions.
    - You will assist the <color="green">Revenant</color> in finishing the task at
      hand. I expect you will have no problem being led by the one that bested you
      in combat?
