    - Argh!
    - "You dare\u2026 you dare to strike me down, after all I have given you? Every
      scrap of power, every piece of knowledge, the very life that you cling to\u2026"
    - 'You were nothing without me. I lifted you from the dirt and gave you purpose,
      and now you stand there, proud in your treachery, so certain of your truth. '
    - Yet all you have are the words of fools and traitors. Did it never occur to
      you how easily you were led?
