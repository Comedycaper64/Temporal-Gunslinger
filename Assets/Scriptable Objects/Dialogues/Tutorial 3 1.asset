    - Satisfactory.
    - I would clarify that you are able to affect any projectile.
    - Focusing on another nearby projectile and Shifting across to it will allow
      you to impart your redirections onto it.
    - One last test. A mask will spit a flame at you. Redirect it to extinguish both
      masks.
