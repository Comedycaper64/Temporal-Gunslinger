    dialogue:
    - Good.
    - You can also use your coins to redirect other projectiles. Possess them [W],
      then redirect them [L. Click] as you did your bullet.
    - I shall allow you to practice by having one of my masks spit fire at you. Redirect
      it so that it does not strike you.
    - The timepiece will foretell when a projectile will come into contact with you
      and stop time to prevent it from destroying you completely. You will need to
      rewind or step back in time to the beginning of an encounter if you allow a
      projectile to strike you.
