    - I see. Perhaps I should have explained this sooner.
    - "Like you, Heralds\u2019 souls need a physical form to survive. When you killed
      the Emperor, you forced Conquest out of his body. His soul latched onto the
      only other vessel powerful enough to contain it."
    - You.

    - 'Greetings, Conquest. I cannot hear you, but I know you can hear me. '
    - I regret that it had to come to this. You were a good man, but you were foolish
      to think any good could come of your recklessness.
    - Fortunately, owing to the Revenant, you will have plenty of time to reflect
      on your actions.
