    dialogue:
    - Congratulations, it appears my gifts were not wasted upon you.
    - Now be off. The Timepiece will allow you to apparate within the time period
      that my subordinates have fled to.
    - They have possessed great historical figures, puppeting them to cause mass
      fatalities.
    - The fools believe that they can become Reapers through sheer slaughter. They
      will pay for their mistake.
    - You will appear close to where they preside. It is your duty to make your way
      towards them and execute them.
    - Their corruptive influence has likely taken over their close followers, who
      will try to stop you. Dispose of them as you will.
    - Ah, one last matter.
    - My coins carry quite a measure of power, and are not limitless.
    - My eyes will be ever on you. Should you encounter resistance I shall bestow
      upon you an appropriate number of coins.
    - They do not stand a chance. You have the power of time in your hands.
