    - As you wish.
    - My Heralds have gone into hiding, each possessing a powerful figure from the
      times they walked the world as living souls.
    - As we speak, they are growing their power, influencing the actions and decisions
      of their hosts to serve their own goals.
    - Once strong enough, each Herald will manifest and unleash chaos upon the Mortal
      Realm.
    - However, upon manifestation, a Herald is defensively at their weakest. I wish
      for you to travel to the relevant time periods and, when the time is right,
      eliminate them.
