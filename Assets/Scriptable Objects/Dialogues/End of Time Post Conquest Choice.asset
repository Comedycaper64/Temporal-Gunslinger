      - You bested me without knowing my powers? This humiliation is too much to
        bear...
      - ...
      - 'I was imbued with two powers when I became a Herald.

'
      - One was tied to my sword, Balmung. I was able to dominate others with my
        presence, leading the populace to single-mindedly work for the war effort.
      - The Reaper has reclaimed the sword, and the power along with it.
      - However, I still have some control over my latent ability to conjure portals.
        I presume that is how the Reaper wishes me to contribute.

      - Ah, I shall explain.
      - To each of my friends I have bestowed a single item, and with it a single
        ability. But making contact with a powerful relic can awaken one's latent
        ability.
      - The same happened to you, old friend. The pocketwatch is the item of power
        I gave you. The power to redirect bullets is one that you manifested.
      - "Though, to be clear, this power still comes from the staff. I have partial
        control over how you use it because of the Coins.\r"
      - 'I foolishly gave the Heralds full control over their latent powers. I have
        learned from my errors.

        to sway you once you come face-to-face.

'
      - "Furthermore, he has affinity with money. Any currency, to be exact.\r"
      - I fear that it may be difficult for me to grant you coins while you are within
        his domain.
