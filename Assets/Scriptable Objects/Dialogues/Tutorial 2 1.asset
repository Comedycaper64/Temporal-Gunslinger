    dialogue:
    - 
    - Well met, Revenant.
    - I'm afraid I require your services once more.
    - My subordinates have forsaken me, they have scattered across the winds of time
      and attempt to usurp my station.
    - You shall dispose of them.
    - Powerful though they are, I shall grant you a power greater.
    - Take these gifts of mine. The Reaper Coins and the Timepiece.
    - The coins are infused with a power to complement your firearm. They allow projectiles
      to be redirected as they fly.
    - Simply focus, as if you were aiming your firearm, and fire.
    - I offer a test to verify your capability. I shall summon two masks of mine.
      Destroy them with a single bullet.
    - Do not be concerned if you fail, the Timepiece bestows upon you the power to
      rewind time as you desire.
    - Now, demonstrate your competence.
