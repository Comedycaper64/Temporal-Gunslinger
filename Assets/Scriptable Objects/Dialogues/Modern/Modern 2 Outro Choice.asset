      - <alpha=#55>It is unfortunate, but <i>necessary</i>, old friend.
      - <alpha=#55>They are vessels for a dangerous, unknown threat. Moreover, they
        are a perversion of the natural balance of Life and Death itself.
      - <alpha=#55>I can sense it. These beings were once the dead that littered
        the frozen wastes. Her plague appears to have granted them <i>second life</i>.

      - <alpha=#55>I believe I have an answer for you now.
      - "<alpha=#55>Much of <color=\"purple\">Pestilence</color><alpha=#55>\u2019s
        life was spent researching the properties of a crystalline growth found on
        roses caused by a virus."
      - "<alpha=#55>I shall not pretend to understand the details, but I can offer
        a simple explanation. In essence, these growths are capable of enhancing
        a plant\u2019s natural photosynthesis, and are even capable of generating
        energy to sustain themselves once the plant is dead. "
      - "<alpha=#55>I bring this up now as <color=\"purple\">Pestilence</color><alpha=#55>\u2019s
        latent ability is the power to conjure elements of the natural world."
      - <alpha=#55>It seems she is capable of summoning the growths, and has deduced
        how to harvest the energy from them. I believe this is powering the facility.
