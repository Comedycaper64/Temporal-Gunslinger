      - <alpha=#55>It is unfortunate, but necessary, old friend.
      - <alpha=#55>They are vessels for a dangerous, unknown threat. Moreover, they
        are a perversion of the natural balance of Life and Death itself.
      - <alpha=#55>I can sense it. These beings were once the dead that littered
        the frozen wastes. Her plague appears to have granted them second life.

      - <alpha=#55>I believe I have an answer for you now.
      - "Much of Pestilence\u2019s life was spent researching the properties of a
        crystalline growth found on roses caused by a virus."
      - "I shall not pretend to understand the details, but I can offer a simple
        explanation. In essence, these growths are capable of enhancing a plant\u2019s
        natural photosynthesis, and are even capable of generating energy to sustain
        themselves once the plant is dead. "
      - "I bring this up now as Pestilence\u2019s latent ability is the power to
        conjure elements of the natural world."
      - <alpha=#55>It seems she is capable of summoning the growths, and has deduced
        how to harvest the energy from them. I believe this is powering the facility.
