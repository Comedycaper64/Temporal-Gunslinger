        wastes. Her peculiar plague has granted them second life.

      - <alpha=#55>I believe I have an answer for you now.
      - <alpha=#55>The scattered pink gems are special. They are a naturally occurring
        crystal that emits a form of energy.
      - '<alpha=#55>If I recall, during her life <color="purple">Pestilence</color><alpha=#55>
        spent much time researching them, but I shall speak on that later. '
      - <alpha=#55>More important is her latent power. She has the ability to conjure
        elements of the natural world in small quantities.
      - <alpha=#55>She seems to have been able to summon these crystals and work
        out how to <i>harvest</i> their power, facilitating the use of what we have
        seen.
