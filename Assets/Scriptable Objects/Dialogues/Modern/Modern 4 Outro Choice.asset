      - 'Indeed.

'
      - We may share a title, but that is all. I assume we were given our power at
        separate times, and then lingered as spirits within the time period that
        we existed in.
      - "I doubt that I could have been graced with <color=\"yellow\">Famine</color>\u2019s
        presence, and that is likely for the best."

        we\u2019ll be goin\u2019 the same way."

      - <alpha=#55>My best guess is that <color="purple">Pestilence</color><alpha=#55>
        is refining a disease that will cause great damage to the world. It will
        likely be easier to kill her than to destroy her work.
      - <alpha=#55>You can reason with her after she has joined you.

      - <alpha=#55>What we are doing here is just. <color="purple">Pestilence</color><alpha=#55>
        seeks to upend the balance between Life and Death. This has to be done, lest
        the universe is torn asunder.
      - <alpha=#55>There is no choice to be made. I do not know what to expect from
        her, but if you remain vigilant then we will succeed.
      - <alpha=#55>As always, old friend, good luck.
