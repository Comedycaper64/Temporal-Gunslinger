      - "<alpha=#55>That is correct.\r"
      - "<alpha=#55>Before her passing she was an environmentalist and scientist.
        I believe her focus was revitalising ecosystems and researching renewable
        sources of energy. She lobbied against corporations that exploited and polluted
        the earth.\r"
      - <alpha=#55>She had begun to experiment on the crystals you see adorning this
        facility. She touted them as a clean and regenerative source of energy that
        could replace coal and oil, given enough time.
      - '<alpha=#55>Shortly afterwards, she went missing. It was claimed that she
        put an end to her work after failing to obtain any satisfactory results.
        In actuality, she had been buried in a shallow grave with a bullet in her
        heart.

        her one of my Heralds. Though it seems that she has regained some of her
        spirit, judging by the flagrant use of her powers.
      - "<alpha=#55>Unlike the two that reside within you, I do not believe that
        she possessed a <i>person of power</i> or influence. I am not yet certain,
        but it\u2019s possible that she has reclaimed her own body."
      - <alpha=#55>She is a tragic soul, but that must not stop you from carrying
        out your work.
