      dialogue:
      - Indeed.
      - "Pestilence\u2019s tale begins in an unlikely place: a greenhouse. At the
        time, she was a botany student and had returned from a week away to find
        an unusual disease had infected some of her roses."
      - 'The disease produced unsightly crystalline growths on the leaves of the
        affected plants. However, she also noticed the infected roses grew taller
        and straighter, their flowers bigger and brighter. '
      - "She collected some cuttings and brought them to the laboratory at her university.
        To her surprise, the growths had not only boosted the roses\u2019 natural
        photosynthesis, but were also capable of continuing the process on their
        own when removed from the leaves."
      - In other words, this growth was capable of sustaining itself and producing
        its own energy.
      - 'She presented her findings in a research journal, suggesting these growths
        might be used as a clean and renewable source of energy that, given enough
        time, could replace the need for burning fossil fuels entirely. '
      - While she oddly struggled to obtain the funding required to continue her
        research, she nonetheless resolved to continue at own expense. Shortly afterwards,
        she went missing.
      - It was claimed that she ceased her research after failing to obtain any satisfactory
        results. In truth, she had been buried in a shallow grave with a bullet in
        her heart.

      - Pestilence was despondent when I first named her one of my Heralds. It appears
        she has regained some of her spirit, given the flagrant use of her powers.
      - Unlike the two that reside within you, I do not believe she has possessed
        a person of great power or influence. I am not yet certain, but it is possible
        that she has reclaimed her own body.
      - Her story is perhaps the most harrowing of all the Heralds, but that must
        not stop you from your task, old friend.

      - When I granted them their powers, I acted to ensure their actions would not
        have any grievous implications on the universe.
      - While they understood at first, they soon rejected my guidance. They believed
        themselves to be more knowledgeable than I, and began to weave foolish plans
        from their childish fantasies of a better world.

        was always too darn afraid to let us decide the right thing to do."
