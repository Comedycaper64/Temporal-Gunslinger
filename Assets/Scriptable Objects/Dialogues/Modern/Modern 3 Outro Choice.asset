      - <alpha=#55>Indeed.
      - "<color=\"purple\">Pestilence</color><alpha=#55>\u2019s tale begins in an
        unlikely place: a greenhouse. At the time, she was a botany student and had
        returned from a week away to find an unusual disease had infected some of
        her roses."
      - '<alpha=#55>The disease produced unsightly crystalline growths on the leaves
        of the affected plants. However, she also noticed the infected roses grew
        taller and straighter, their flowers bigger and brighter. '
      - "<alpha=#55>She collected some cuttings and brought them to the laboratory
        at her university. To her surprise, the growths had not only boosted the
        roses\u2019 natural photosynthesis, but were also capable of continuing the
        process on their own when removed from the leaves."
      - <alpha=#55>In other words, this growth was capable of sustaining itself and
        producing its own energy.
      - '<alpha=#55>She presented her findings in a research journal, suggesting
        these growths might be used as a clean and renewable source of energy that,
        given enough time, could replace the need for burning fossil fuels entirely. '
      - <alpha=#55>While she oddly struggled to obtain the funding required to continue
        her research, she nonetheless resolved to continue at own expense. Shortly
        afterwards, she went missing.
      - <alpha=#55>It was claimed that she ceased her research after failing to obtain
        any satisfactory results. In truth, she had been buried in a shallow grave
        with a bullet in her heart.

        named her one of my Heralds. It appears she has regained some of her spirit,
        given the flagrant use of her powers.
      - <alpha=#55>Unlike the two that reside within you, I do not believe she has
        possessed a person of great power or influence. I am not yet certain, but
        it is possible that she has reclaimed her own body.
      - <alpha=#55>Her story is perhaps the most harrowing of all the Heralds, but
        that must not stop you from your task, old friend.
