    dialogue:
    - "How do I put this\u2026?\r"
    - "Humans are so cruel to one another. We\u2019re selfish, we\u2019re corruptible,
      and we\u2019re difficult to understand."
    - "But what if we <i>could</i> understand each other? Consider each other\u2019s
      thoughts, feel each other\u2019s emotions, share each other\u2019s wants and
      desires, as if they were our own?"
    - My goal is to create a shared neural network for humanity, a little like a
      hivemind. To do this, I synthesised a virus.
    - "The initial results are promising\u2026 but not perfect, as you can see. When
      they\u2019re connected through the virus, they experience every sensation felt
      by each of the others linked to them, positive or negative. And so, if one
      dies, the pain is great enough to kill all that share the link."
    - "But the good news is I\u2019ve almost finished cultivating a mutated strain,
      which shouldn\u2019t have that flaw."
    - "Sorry, I know I\u2019m rambling. What\u2019s important is that I\u2019m trying
      to give humanity the chance to truly connect with one another."
