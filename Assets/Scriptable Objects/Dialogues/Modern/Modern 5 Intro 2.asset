    - ...
    - Are you familiar with hiveminds? My goal was to create a shared intelligence
      network for humanity.
    - "As you can see, the results haven\u2019t been perfect yet\u2026 When they\u2019re
      connected by the virus they feel the pain of everybody else linked to them.
      \u2026 If one dies, the pain is great enough to kill all that share the link."
    - "I\u2019ve almost finished cultivating the newest version, which shouldn\u2019t
      have that flaw."
    - "I\u2019m trying to allow humanity the chance to truly connect with one another.
      Surely we can all strive forward more effectively when our barriers have been
      lowered?\r"
